# WHO SMART GUIDELINES - Surveillance Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK)

The Surveillance Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) focuses on infectious disease surveillance includes both disease-agnostic components and disease-specific modules for conditions including cholera, measles, bacterial meningitis, and yellow fever. This Digital adaptation kit (DAK) aims to provide a common language across several audiences – disease area programme managers, software developers and implementers of digital systems – to ensure a common understanding of the appropriate health information content within a defined health programme area, as a mechanism to catalyse the effective use of these digital systems.

The key objectives of the DAK are:

   - to ensure adherence to WHO clinical, public health and data use guidelines, and facilitate consistency of the health content that is used to inform the development of a surveillance system;
   - to enable both health programme leads and digital health teams (including software developers) to have a joint understanding of the health content within the digital system, with a transparent mechanism to review the validity and accuracy of the health content; and
   - to provide a starting point of the core data elements and indicators that should be included within surveillance systems for disease surveillance.

Information detailed in this DAK reflects data elements, generic workflow processes, decision-support algorithms, functional and non-functional requirements as derived from WHO guidelines and guidance documents for various diseases listed in Table 3 of the DAK.

The SRV DAK publication can be found here [IRIS link forthcoming].
